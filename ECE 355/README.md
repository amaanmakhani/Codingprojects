# Microprocessor-Based Systems
- Lab Demo:
  - A system that measures the frequency of a square-wave signal generated by a Function Generator. The signal period and frequency are then displayed on the console.
- Final Project:
  - An embedded system for monitoring and controlling a pulse-widthmodulated (PWM) signal generated by an external 555 timer (NE555 IC). An external optocoupler (4N35 IC), driven by the microcontroller on the STMF0 Discovery board, is used to control the frequency of the PWM signal. The microcontroller is used to measure the voltage across a potentiometer (POT) and relay it to the external optocoupler for controlling the PWM signal frequency. The microcontroller will also be used to measure the frequency of the generated PWM signal. The measured frequency and the corresponding POT resistance are displayed on the LCD.
