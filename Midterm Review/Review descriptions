Midterm 1 Review Exercises:
For each of the following problems, write a syntactically correct C++ program that accomplishes the described task. You should write functions for each task and test them with sample inputs to ensure their correctness.

Given a vector of integers, compute the minimum, maximum, and median value. Write each as a separate function. Recall that the median is the "middle" value of the sorted list. If there is an even number of elements, then the median is simply the average of the two middle elements. You can use the sort function covered in the labs to compute the median.
Given a vector of strings with mixed capitalization, modify this vector such that all the strings have their capitalization inverted. So if a character is lowercase, it should be converted to uppercase and vice-versa.
Given two strings with mixed case, write a function that returns true if both strings are equal, false otherwise. The comparison must be done in the same case (be it upper or lowercase). Note that the capitalization may not be consistent between strings. For example, HeLlO should be equal as hElLo.
Given a string, return another string that contains the result of incrementing each character by one. Note that if we have char c{'a'};, then char d = c + 1; makes d = 'b' and so forth.
Given a string and a range of indices, return the portion of the string that exists between these indices. For example, given the string "hello" and indices 0, 2, the function would return "hel".
Design a program that prints out the current time as entered by the user. First design a struct that will hold hours, minutes, and whether it is am or pm. Parse the input from the user, which you may assume will be in 24-hour format (so 1pm is 13:00) and print out the final time.
Given a vector of integers and two values a and b, return a vector whose values are in the range [a, b].
Given a vector of strings, write a function that checks if any string appears more than once.
Extend the above program to do the following: given a vector of strings, return a new vector that contains any string that appears more than once. The new vector must contain only one occurrence of each word.
Given a vector of strings, modify this vector such that the first letter of each word is capitalized. You may assume that the strings are all lowercase, and are separated by one or more spaces. There are no hyphens or extra punctuation.
Given a vector of numbers (they can be of any type) return a new vector that contains only the values that are positive.
Extend the above function to return a new vector with numbers that are greater than a provided value.
