# Embedded Systems
- Characteristics and design of embedded systems
- Techniques for specification, exploration and refinement
- System partitioning and hardware/software co-design
- Tools for validation, verification and simulation
- Final project dealt with improving matrix inversion:
  - 13-bit signed integers
  - 10X10 matrix
  - Test bench contained:
    - A well-conditioned matrix
    - A ill-conditioned matrix
  - Used Gauss-Jordan algorithm with pivoting and integer arithmetic
  - A pure-software solution was created and optimized with a software solution
  - Hardware support was simulated for vanishing the column elements
