Assignment description:
This File contains a encoder is built to compress data for smaller transition by replacing
words with fewer codes and character. This File also contains a decoder used to reverse the change.

Assignment functions:
Encoder:
-Reads lines in from file
-Prints magic numbers
-Separates unique words and places them in a dictionary
-If unique word hasn't used print the word and the index
-Then delete it from dictionary, and add it to the stack
-If it's in the stack find the index and put it on top
-output all of this to a file with .mtf file

Decoder:
-Open MTF file
-Turn bytes into ASCII representation
-Check for Magic Numbers, if there is no magic numbers in file exit
-Find the numbers 129 and greater so I know which ones are numbers
-If new line put that in file
-If number then number put into stack and get word from that position and pop it
-If number than word create string for word
-Output all to a txt file

Scripts:
-Run all necessary tests
-Return pass or fail result

Innovative features:
In program:
	-Using default value in function definition
	-Using try and catch blocks to catch files that don't exist, or can't be opened
In the script:
	-sophisticated testing
	-color change for better indication
	-checks invalid handling to for decoding version
