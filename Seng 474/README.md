# Tennis Prediction Model Project
Tennis poses some unique challenges concerning machine learning. With three different playing surfaces, varying climates and conditions, and diverse playing styles and strategies. This makes it difficult to predict a match outcome when any tennis match's momentum can swing in the matter of a few successfully placed strokes. Our team used a well-established ATP tour dataset from Kaggle and trained the selected models to predict match and tournament outcomes. In particular we predicted matches from 2000-2017 and then predicted the 2019 Australian Open. We then compared the results with the actual outcome of these matches and tournaments. From these models the Linear Neural Network was the most effective.
